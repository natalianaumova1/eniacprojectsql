### Data Analysis to assess the possible outcome of Eniac's expansion to the Brazilian market.

## Project Overview

This data analysis project explores the potential of Eniac, a European tech accessories company, expanding into the Brazilian e-commerce market. Eniac is considering a partnership with Magist, a local SaaS provider that offers integrated logistics, warehousing, and customer support for small and medium-sized businesses.

Using a snapshot of Magist’s internal data, the project investigates two key concerns:

- Whether Magist is a suitable partner for Eniac’s high-end, Apple-compatible tech products.

- Whether Magist’s logistics, especially its delivery services via the Brazilian Post Office, meet Eniac’s standards for fast shipping.

The findings aim to support Eniac’s decision-making regarding a 3-year contract with Magist, helping the company enter the Brazilian market while maintaining its reputation for high-quality service.
